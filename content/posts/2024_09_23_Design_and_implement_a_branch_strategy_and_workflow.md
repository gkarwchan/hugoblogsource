# Chose a branching strategy:

Chosing the right Git workflow for your team can enhance the team effectiveness and increase its productivity. To chose the correct strategy there are some considerations:  

* Scalability: does this workflow scale when the team expand in size.
* Undo mistakes: how easy it is to undo mistakes and errors?
* Overhead works: how much overhead work (like fixing merge conflicts, or waiting for CI/CD process), this workflow will add to the team.

# Common branch workflows:

### Trunk-based workflow

### GitHub Flow

### Feature-branch workflow

### Release Branch Workflow
