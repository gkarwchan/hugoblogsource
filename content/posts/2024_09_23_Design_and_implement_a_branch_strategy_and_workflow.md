# Chose a branching strategy:

Chosing the right Git workflow for your team can enhance the team effectiveness and increase its productivity. To chose the correct strategy there are some considerations:  

* Scalability: does this workflow scale when the team expand in size.
* Undo mistakes: how easy it is to undo mistakes and errors?
* Overhead works: how much overhead work (like fixing merge conflicts, or waiting for CI/CD process), this workflow will add to the team.

Every organization should settle on a standard code release process to ensure consistency across teams. The Microsoft release flow incorporates DevOps processes from development to release. The basic steps of the release flow consist of branch, push, pull request, and merge.

# Common branch workflows:

### Trunk-based workflow

The core idea behind the [Trunk-based Development Workflow](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/) is that all development work takes place directly on the main branch (often called "trunk" or "master"). This approach emphasizes continuous integration, with developers frequently committing small, incremental changes to the main branch. Continuous integration and automated testing play a crucial role in maintaining code quality and stability.
